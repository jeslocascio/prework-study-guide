# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

In this project, I was introduced to the coding languages to HTML, Git, CSS, and JavaScript. Through the use of these languages, I set out to produce a webpage that will help me properly categorize, and study, notes I will be attaining throughout my following Coding Bootcamp, provided by Rutgers University. Now that I have a solid foundational understanding of these languages, I am ready to begin my journey into the world of coding.
